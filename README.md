# Employee-Directory

## Overview

A searchable database of users, using React. For demo purposes, the data was a list of github users via an axios request.

## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

# Built With
* [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Editor
* Javascript, React, HTML, CSS

## Testing

Lighhouse testing revealed a good app with some issues with accessibility:
